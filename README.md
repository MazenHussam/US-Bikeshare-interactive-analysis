# US-Bikeshare-interactive-analysis
In this project, I used Python and Pandas to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code is written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics like:

1- Popular times of travel:

most common month
most common day of week 
most common hour of day

2- Popular stations and trip

most common start station 
most common end station 
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3- Trip duration

total travel time average travel time

4- User info counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
